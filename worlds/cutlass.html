        <h1>Cutlass</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>Imagine a world where steam still runs through the heart of any major machine. A world of Victorian era nobles and a Cocneyed lower class. A world where metal is everywhere and spare parts can be gleaned off of any unsuspecting ship or building. This is the essence of Cutlass. There exist two classes that bicker and constantly find themselves at odds. The Vicks and the Scavs have a rough history in this world filled with smoke and steam. The Vicks created the Iron to keep law and police the Scavs. More often then not stings go bad and the Iron find themselves having to deal with the inventive weaponry of the Scavs.

        <h2>Vicks</h2>
        <hr>
        Vick is a term of endearment thrust upon the upper class by the self proclaimed Scavs. The Vicks adopted the term to help emphasise the difference between the two classes. Though it is debated and used rather seldomly among themselves. The Vicks have yet to adopt the self proclaimed name for the lower class and simply refer to them as it. A Vick is to keep themselves clean by not associating with the Scavs so they created the Iron, a grand police force, to deal with the black market bootleggers dealing in the cities. The Iron all carry standard issue pistols as well as a night baton should trouble arise. The main trouble usually is that, somehow, the Scavs carry better heat than the Iron.

        <h2>Scavs</h2>
        <hr>
        Scavs are the lower class in Cutlass. They represent the factory workers and bootleggers that run the bottom of society. Unfortunatly most of society is deemed a Scav and there is not a huge middle class. Scavs get by by digging through junk piles to find scraps they can use for their machines. In Cutlass machinery is a skill overlooked by none. Scavs have a remarkable talent for this creation of technology. Even though they are pushed to pillage the junkyard for parts they can create anything once they find the right parts. Every bootlegger, be it grunt or boss, carries their own personalized weapon. Most are usually some combination of a melee weapon and a pistol or a rifle. Anything they can use they will to protect themselves from the constant raids and sting operations of the Iron.
