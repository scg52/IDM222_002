        <h1>Coriath</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>Coriath is a fantasy world filled with the most raucous and vicarious bunch of brawlers. This world runs on a leadership derived from, he who wields the biggest stick usually is the better warrior. The name of the world itself came from a legendary warrior who fought Xilix with only a giant metal club and won. Coriath then brought back a splash of Aether for the warriors of his world to wield. This led to larger weapons and more devastating attacks. After a while only those who could master the Auric shield were left on the battlefield. Eventually the world subdued once it became united and the strange disappearances have brought a new surge of battlelust among the land. Most people of Coriath are hearty, standing at an average of six foot six inches and weighing a muscular ton. The men don beards and the women grow their hair long. They are a people of fiery might and jovial drinkers.</p>

            <p>Humans of Coriath are a lively bunch of brutes. They flex their muscles and tote their maces, clubs, and axes. Swords are a rare sight only because cutting through an Auric Shield is less likely than shattering it altogether. When a warrior is seen with a sword it is usually longer than the wielder is tall. Humans also relish in the magic that was granted them by Xilix once he was defeated. They use this magic to propel their weapons at devastating speeds to crush and mangle their opponent with the raw power of the elements. There is slight tension between the Human and Fen factions of Coriath but most problems can be solved by sparring then a tall drink.</p>

        <h3>Auric Shield</h3>
        <br>
        <div class="row">
          <p>An Auric shield is the manifestation of one's aura to help block an incoming attack. This shield is exceptionally useful due to the fact that it can block both physical and magical attacks. The downside is that an Auric Shield will only last so long. It will either succumb to a certain amount of damage or a time constraint depending on how the user was trained to use it. Some practiced to be able to hold the shield forever, this results in the shield breaking after it has reached a certain limit. The other method of training is a shield that can block an unlimited amount of damage yet only lasts a short while.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="textwide">
            <p>Fen are creatures that have major human features such as being bipedal and intelligent. However most Fen more resemble the animals that inhabit Coriath rather than the Humans that tread its soil. Another major difference is that Fen can use magical attacks, but they cannot use Auric Shield. They rely on their natural features to grant them the defense to hold out in battle. This is why most Fen on the battlefield are related to more hearty creatures such as Lions, Dragons, and Bears to name a few.</p>
