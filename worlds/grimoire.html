        <h1>Grimoire</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>The world of Grimoire is a dark world ruled by creatures that thrive in shadow. There are many Eldritch horrors which stalk the night looking for any poor human that might be unlucky enough to meet them. Although danger is everpresent in Grimoire order is not. The world is run by three royal families of Human, Vampire, and Lycan. Grimoire is no stranger to political unrest. Assassins thrive in the darkness of this world. Lycans aside most humans and human form vampires are a medium sized folk. They regard properness and civility as the core of their society, until the fangs come out.

        <h2>Humans</h2>
        <hr>
        Ordinary humans are mostly a rare sight in Grimoire. Most pure humans are either quickly devoured or converted to either the coven or the pack. The only humans that are off limits are those of the Royal Von Goethe family. They represent the human house of the three ruling houses. The Von Goethes also hold the least amount of power between the three houses. To make up for that fact the Von Goethes hold the swing vote if there is a major dispute between the other two houses. Humans may be lacking in physical apsects when compared to the Lycans or the Vampires. The defining aspect that humanity holds above the other two races is alchemy. They are the only ones who can harness this meager splash of Aether.

        <h2>Lycan</h2>
        <hr>
        Lycans are a primal force among Grimoire. The pack rules the woodlands and the marshes that fill the void between the towns and cities of Grimoire. In human form a Lycan can be recognized by their larger stature and excess body hair. Also the main distinguishing fact to prove someone is a Lycan is when they don canine features. As the name implies each of the Lycan lineage can don a Lycan form which gives them a damage and health boost while compromising control. This frenzy of raw power may hurt anything close to its impulsive rampage.

        <h2>Vampire</h2>
        <hr>
        The Coven is the most regal of the three houses. They rule the cities and townships of Grimoire. With their extended lives each member of the Coven has seen their fair share of combat. They are masters of darkness making some of the best assassins and rogues. All members of the bloodline also share a special trait called The Bloodlust. Once activated they can regain health from using their basic attack against enemies. During Bloodlust a Vampire can also shadow walk, an ability where they can move as a shadow for one turn. The only drawback of Bloodlust is sunlight. When Bloodlust is activated in direct sunlight the vampire takes damage every turn they are in sunlight and Bloodlust is active. Shadow Walk cannot be activated in direct sunlight.
