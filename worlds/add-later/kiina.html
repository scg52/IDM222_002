      <div class="description">
        <p>Ki'ina is a brilliant world of magical culture. This island world is full of bright mages and ornate stone pyramids. Ki'ina is arranged into four main tribes of mage. The Chokta are a tribe of battle mages who specialize in fire magic and attack. Moale is a tribe of healers who specialize in the element of water. Linma is the tribe of earth, they are the inventors and builders of the world. The final tribe is the Ikite. Though the air mages number the least they are powerful warriors capable of manipulating the air itself.

        <h2>Mages of Ki'ina</h2>
        <hr>
         The mages of Ki'ina are an intuitive race of Aether wielding humans. While divided into clans they each strive to be able to use pure Aether magic. Through the magic of the four main elements. Most scholars agree that the mastery of all the elemental magics will lead to the enlightening of Aether magic. Each tribe has a differnt mindset when tackling the achievement of enlightenment. Mages of Ki'ina are recognizable by the totems they wear. To help channel their magical power each mage will carry an elemental totem and most will carry a secondary totem of another element. The tribes are not restricted to the element they represent, that merely indicates how they practice their magic and how they believe they can achieve enlightenment.
        <br> 
        <br>
        <h3>Chokta</h3>
        <br>
        The fire mages of Chokta believe that through combat mastery they can achieve enlightenment. By channeling the raw power of the elements they fight on to find the true secret of power. These mages are quick to act and provide a fierce foe if angered. Chokta mages are ruled by their emotions. They excel at mid ranged attacks of devastating proportion. The Chokta created the first proper military on Ki'ina.
        <br> 
        <br>
        <h3>Moale</h3>
        <br>
        Moale is the tribe of water. They believe that true enlightenment is achieved by feeling the power of the world and channeling it, using themselves as conduits. These channelers excel at the healing arts due to their connection with the body. The Moale understand the human body better than any other mage on Ki'ina. Talented Moale can even heal minor wounds from across a room. 
        <br> 
        <br>
        <h3>Linma</h3>
        <br>
        Linma are the artisans of Ki'ina. They mold the earth they represent and find beauty in everything. Linam believe that by creating beauty they will recieve divine inspiration and find enlightenment. These earthen artisans are the reason the cities of Ki'ina are so ornate. They are also excellent shipbuilders. Airships are the latest creation the Linma have devised. Now boats are slowly becoming the secondary mode of travel. 
        <br> 
        <br>
        <h3>Ikite</h3>
        <br>
        Ikite mages are solitary creatures. They believe that each member must achieve enlightenment by their own accord. Some of the greatest Ikite masters have even achieved feats such as walking on water and levitation. They remain in family groups until the child is ready to find their way in the world. Ikite parents will usually travel together once paired but wander once parenting duties are done.
