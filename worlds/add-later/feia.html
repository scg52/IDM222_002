        <h1>Feia</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>Aether flows through the very veins of Feia. Massive winding tree trunks seem to want to emulate these veins and the vines serving as the nerves. All of Feia is covered in a mystical forest which flows to the tune of the Aether. The inhabitants of Feia can tap into the life force of this world and channel it through themselves. This usually takes the form of forest elementals, which have massive stature yet gentle attitudes. The people of Feia are sleek and flighty like birds. Still the Feians must keep their distance when hunting because the creatures of Feia are gargantuan. Feians have developed elongated pointed ears to help guard against becoming the hunted.

        <h2>Feians</h2>
        <hr>
        Feians are gentle and slender creatures. They are Feia's rendition of humans, yet much more in tune with the world around them. They traverse the world by following the Ley lines that crisscross around the world. There is no centralized governing body since the tribes understand their boundries and respect each other. When conflict does arise bows are drawn and the forest becomes a hail of poison dipped arrows and branches mangling flesh. Many Feians also have a creature they are spiritually linked to. If one ever comes into danger the other will be there to defend them.
        <br>

        <h3>Heart of the World</h3>
        <br>
        Feians come of age by mastering the channeled energy of Feia itself. Once they can create their own guardian they are allowed to go on hunt with the adults. It is rumored that should this channeling take place on other worlds there would be a different result. Though the topic of other worlds does not come up often it seems to have materialized more as Feians disapear and the glowing ships become more plentiful.

        <h2>Morlocks</h2>
        <hr>
        **This is not a playable race** <br>
        Even the caverns under the great forests are filled with the magical Aether that courses through Feia. Amid the large spiders and bioluminescent fungi there lurk another species that rules the underworld. These large eight foot tall extremely hairy creatures are called the Morlocks. These creatures venture out once the sun sets to hunt for any prey they can manage. Some elders believe these monsters are the reason Feians first took to the trees since Morlocks have difficulty climbing. Some Morlocks are reported to even live above ground in thick marshy areas. They are good swimmers and can kill any creature unfortunate enough to fall into the swamps. Most Morlocks are capable of crafting rudimentary spears and rope. Other than that they are not known to have any other tools at their disposal.
