        <h2>Basic Combat</h2>

            <p>As in most TRPG's combat starts with rolling initiative. Initiative is to see what the turn order is, whoever rolled highest goes first and lowest goes last. All non players take their turn at the same time. On each player's tunr they can make two actions. They can either move or use an ability. For sake of ease basic attacks are counted as abilities. On a movement action the player can move up to their max movement of three spaces. During an ability action the player can use any ability their weapon grants them. Players may choose to perform two of the same action or one of each.</p>

        <h2>Weapons</h2>
        <hr>
        <div class="row">
            <p>Before combat begins a player must choose which weapon they will use in that fight. During combat each weapon has a set of special abilities that it grants to it's wielder. Some abilities are simply damage based but others provide mobility or crowd control for the player. Each weapon has three abilities. There are two basic abilities and one ultimate ability. The two basic abilities have cooldown of one turn so they can affectivly be used every other turn if the character has the mana. Ultimate abilities can only be used once per day. The character must take a large rest, like sleeping through the night, to recharge their ultimates. A weapon's ultimate is highly powerful so it cannot be used all the time.</p>

        <h2>Special Abilities</h2>
        <hr>
        <div class="row">
          <div>
            <p>As discussed in the previous section each weapon has three abilities it can use. Racial traits are a fourth ability that a character can use. Some abilities will show up in multiple weapons and combat. Here is a rundown of the most common abilities. 
            <br>
            <br><h3>Mobility</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>Leap</h4>A leap allows a character to jump over or onto any terrain. Leaps generally are shorter in distance than dashes but can be used to either escape or reposition.
            <br><h4>Dash</h4>A dash allows the character to take extra movement during their ability phase.
            <br><h4>Charge</h4>Charging allows the player to move and push an enemy with them. The player charges in a direction and if there is an enemy in the way they get moved into the space in front of where the player ends their charge.
            <br><h4>Swap</h4> A swap is where a charcter switches places with either a character or an enemy.
            <br>
            <br><h3>Crowd Control</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>Hook</h4>The charcter catches an enemy and pulls them to the space in front of the character.
            <br><h4>Push</h4> A push moves an enemy away from the character or projectile with the ability.
            <br><h4>Stun</h4> A stun prevents an enemy from doing any action on their turn.
            <br><h4>Sleep</h4> Anyone who has been slept will not be able to move or attack until they are either hit by anything or have waited the duration of the sleep.
            <br>
            <br><h3>Interruptions</h3>
            Interruption abilities are played on an enemy's turn.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Counter</h4>The charcter takes the damage from an incoming attack ands sends it back at the attacker.
            <br><h4>Block</h4> A character prevents a certain amount of incoming damage.
